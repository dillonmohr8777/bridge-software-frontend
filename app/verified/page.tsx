            Verified is a check on identity and license. It is not a rating, not an endorsement,
            and not a judgment about whether a business is good to work with. Bridge does not
            score members and does not sell a higher badge.
          </p>
          <p className="muted">
            A verified badge is also a point-in-time check. Licenses lapse, so the named contact on
            each record is asked to confirm details on a schedule rather than once at signup.
