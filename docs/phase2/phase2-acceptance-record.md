The current feed is basic and chronological/non-algorithmic for MVP. News Grid is the recommended presentation default, not an approved ranking system.

Private Bridge League/rewards, expanded live directories, subscriptions/payments, marketplace/ordering, and HR functionality are future scope requiring written approval and a change order. External menu, ordering, maps, and social destinations may be represented only as links in the MVP.
